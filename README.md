# Complexity is killing software developers

## Summary
I thought [this article](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3639050/complexity-is-killing-software-developers.html) was pretty interesting. It talks about how software developing and engineering is gradually becoming too difficult to handle as technology is evolving to become more complex. Notably, it compares and contrasts monolithic architecture and microservices, mentioning that the former was much easier to handle. It also compares software development to "a study in entropy" where things just grow more complicated.

## Main Takeaway
What I found the most interesting in this article was the even though technologial advancements are beneficial in a way, from a technical asepect, it multiplies complexity by several times by all the number of tools available for web developers to use.
